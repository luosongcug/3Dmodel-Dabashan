We obtained a 3-D Vs model and maps of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratios in the Dabashan orocline and adjacent areas by joint inversion of surface-wave dispersions, P-wave receiver functions, Ps and SsPmp travel times.

The file "DABASHAN3D.mod" contains the 3-D Vs model.
The file "HK.mod" contains the crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratios.
